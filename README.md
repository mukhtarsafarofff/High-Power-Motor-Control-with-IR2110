The IR2110 is a popular h-bridge half driver. It is designed to drive high voltage MOSFET and IGBT circuits. It does this without the use of p-channel MOSFETs or photovoltaic opto-couplers. The circuit generates HIGH side MOSFET gate voltage from a diode, bootstrap capacitor combination. The IR2110 is an 14-pin DIP IC and I used 2 for a complete h-bridge. The schematic to each half is identical. I used the 15V MOSFET/IGBT gate voltage with a 5-volt regular to supply the digital voltage (VDD) of 5V.
