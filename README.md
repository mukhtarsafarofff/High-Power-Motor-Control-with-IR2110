The IR2110 is a popular h-bridge half driver. It is designed to drive high voltage MOSFET and IGBT circuits. It does this without the use of p-channel MOSFETs or photovoltaic opto-couplers. The circuit generates HIGH side MOSFET gate voltage from a diode, bootstrap capacitor combination. The IR2110 is an 14-pin DIP IC and I used 2 for a complete h-bridge. The schematic to each half is identical. I used the 15V MOSFET/IGBT gate voltage with a 5-volt regular to supply the digital voltage (VDD) of 5V. The motor power supply is separate and is limited by the MOSFETs used and motor voltage up to 500-volts. IR2110 illustration :
1) Pin 9 or VDD is the digital logic positive voltage range 3-15V. This enables the use of CMOS or LS TTL logic.
2) The VDD voltage depends on the type of logic connected to the inputs. I used a 5V Arduino so I connected 5V from a voltage regulator.
